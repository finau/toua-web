      <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Toua</strong> ("we", "our" or "us") collects, uses, discloses, and protects the personal information of users ("you" or "users") when you use our mobile application (the "App"). By installing or using the App you agree to the terms in this Privacy Policy.</p>

      <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
      <p><strong>Toua</strong> is a mobile application provided by <em>Your Company Name</em> (replace with your legal entity). If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, contact us at: <a href="mailto:fkaufusi@gmail.com">fkaufusi@gmail.com</a>.</p>

      <h2>2. What information we collect</h2>
      <p>We may collect information that identifies you (personal data) and other information that does not directly identify you.</p>

      <h3>Account and profile information</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Full name, display name and username</li>
        <li>Email address</li>
        <li>Profile photo (URL)</li>
        <li>Any other information you add to your profile</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Messages and chat data</h3>
      <p>Messages you send and receive through our chat feature are stored in our backend database so they are available to you and your chat partners. Message records typically include sender/receiver IDs, text, timestamps, and delivery/read (seen) status.</p>

      <h3>Device & usage information</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Device identifiers and model</li>
        <li>Operating system and version</li>
        <li>IP address</li>
        <li>App usage diagnostics, crash logs and performance data</li>
        <li>Approximate location (if you enable location services)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Third-party authentication</h3>
      <p>If you sign in using a third party (e.g., Facebook), we receive basic profile information from that provider (name, email, profile photo URL) according to the provider's policies.</p>

      <h2>3. How we use your information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To provide and maintain the App and its features (sign-in, chat, profile).</li>
        <li>To personalize your experience, including showing nearby users when you opt into location sharing.</li>
        <li>To communicate with you, send notifications and updates.</li>
        <li>To detect, investigate and prevent security incidents and abuse.</li>
        <li>For analytics and improving the App.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Sharing and disclosure</h2>
      <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share information in the following circumstances:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>With your consent.</li>
        <li>With service providers who help operate the App (e.g., Firebase, analytics, hosting, messaging providers).</li>
        <li>When required by law, to protect rights, or to respond to lawful requests.</li>
        <li>In connection with a business transfer (sale, merger or asset transfer).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Third-party services and integrations</h2>
      <p>The App uses third-party services such as Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage, Analytics), Facebook Login, and other SDKs. Those third parties may collect information about you in accordance with their privacy policies. Examples include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Firebase</strong> — stores authentication, database and storage data. See: <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a></li>
        <li><strong>Facebook</strong> — used for login and profile information when you choose Facebook sign-in. See: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation">Facebook Data Policy</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Location data</h2>
      <p>Location is only collected if you grant the App permission to access location services. Location is used to provide features such as nearby users. You can revoke location permission in your device settings at any time.</p>

      <h2>7. Cookies and tracking</h2>
      <p>We and our third-party partners use cookies, local storage and similar technologies to provide and improve services. For analytics and advertising, third-party SDKs may collect information as described in their own policies.</p>

      <h2>8. Message retention and deletion</h2>
      <p>Messages and chat metadata are retained on our servers until you or your chat partner delete them or until the account is removed, unless otherwise required by law. If you request deletion of your account, we will delete personal data in accordance with our data retention rules — see "Your rights" below.</p>

      <h2>9. Data security</h2>
      <p>We take reasonable administrative and technical measures intended to protect your personal information. However no internet-connected system is completely secure — we cannot guarantee absolute security. If a data breach occurs, we will comply with applicable laws about notifying affected users and authorities.</p>

      <h2>10. Your rights and choices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Access & correction:</strong> You may view or update certain account information via the App profile screen.</li>
        <li><strong>Deleting your account:</strong> You can request account deletion; we will remove your profile and associated personal data consistent with our retention policies and legal obligations.</li>
        <li><strong>Email communications:</strong> You can opt out of marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions in those emails.</li>
        <li><strong>Data portability & other rights:</strong> Depending on your jurisdiction (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), you may have additional rights. Contact us at <a href="mailto:fkaufusi@gmail.com">fkaufusi@gmail.com</a> to exercise such rights.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>11. Children</h2>
      <p>The App is intended for users 18 years of age or older. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 18. If you believe we have inadvertently collected information about a child under 18, contact us and we will take steps to remove it.</p>

      <h2>12. International transfers</h2>
      <p>Your information may be processed or stored in countries other than your own (for example on servers used by our cloud providers). By using the App you consent to such transfers in accordance with this policy.</p>

      <h2>13. Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make material changes, we will update the "Effective date" and may notify you through the App or by email.</p>

      <h2>14. Contact us</h2>
